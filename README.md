Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is a good place to find out What I am up to this week/month, etc.

## What am I doing now?
### June 2023
This month I am delivering a course I designed, of 20 1-2.5 hour sessions, for GitHub Social Impact, where I am a contractor.  Take a look at some of the pages I threw together to help administer the program.  I made other things too, but you can see it all on the dashboard.

### Helping to transfer Hack for LA to a new fiscal sponsor
from Code for America to Civic Tech Structure, Inc. 501(c)(3)

## What else am I doing
I created a non profit called Civic Tech Structure and I serve as its president.  In that capacity, I am the Executive Director of Hack for LA.  You can see my github profile for that here [github.com/experiementsinhonesty](https://github.com/experiementsinhonesty)
