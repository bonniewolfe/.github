This month I am delivering a course I designed, of 20 1-2.5 hour sessions, for [GitHub Social Impact](https://socialimpact.github.com), where I am a contractor.  Take a look at some of the pages I threw together to help administer the program.  I made other things too, but you can see it all on the dashboard.
