Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is a good place to find out What I am up to this week/month, etc.

## What am I doing this month?
### June 2023
#### Teaching a course on How to be an effective Community Manager
This month I am delivering a course I designed, of 20 1-2.5 hour sessions, for [GitHub Social Impact](https://socialimpact.github.com), where I am a contractor.  Take a look at some of the pages I threw together to help administer the program.  I made other things too, but you can see it all on the dashboard.

### Helping to transfer Hack for LA to a new fiscal sponsor
from Code for America to Civic Tech Structure, Inc. 501(c)(3) aka CTS

#### Setting up the MERL Center under its new fiscal sponsor
GitHub Social Impact transfered ownership of the MERL Center to CTS in May, and we are finishing the setup of the new tools, transfer of assets from 3 parties, hiring team members and making changes to the website.
